## Today's Schedule

- check-in
- midterm review
- help! Classes and Objects
- arrays!

### Midterm Exam

**We have a take-home midterm exam due next week, October 17. Your midterm project is due Oct 24.** Your exam and midterm project are together worth 15%.

Subjects to review:
- Comments
- Variables
 - Types
 - randomness
- println debugging
- conditionals
- loops
- functions
 - arguments
 - return
- translation, rotation, pushMatrix()/popMatrix()
- timer with millis()
- classes and objects
- arrays

### Midterm project

Midterm **exam** is due next week.

Midterm **project** is due in two weeks.

Part B due next week:

Create your creature's class in code. Part C, the final version, will be to implement timers and interactivity to build the 'finite state machine'.

# Arrays

What are they? Arrays are **lists**. An array is a *list* of *data* stored under the same name. You can create an array of any type of data. When you create an array, you can access any of the data stored in that array. We call the location of a piece of data its **index**.

The first location in an array is always 0. We call that position ```[0]```. The second location is ```[1]```. Etc.

**IMPORTANT**: Each array has a variable ```length``` that returns the total number of elements in the array. Keep in mind that arrays start counting at 0 so an array with 10 elements in (a length of 10) will go from location ```[0]``` up to location ```[9]```!

![array type example](assets/img/array-types.png)

```
//from Processing tutorials - Arrays

int[] x = { 
  50, 61, 83, 69, 71, 50, 29, 31, 17, 39
};

fill(0);
// Read one array element each time through the FOR loop
for (int i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
  rect(0, i*10, x[i], 8);
}
```

### Define an Array

You define an array similar to other data types with the addition of brackets [ and ].  When you declare an array you specify what kind of data it will hold. An array can only hold a single data type.

### Three ways to define an array

```
int[] ages; //declaring an array for BTS members' ages

void setup(){
  size(100,100);
  ages = new int[7]; //create space in memory for 7 values
  ages[0] = 27;  //assign
  ages[1] = 26;
  ages[2] = 25;
  ages[3] = 25;
  ages[4] = 24;
  ages[5] = 24;
  ages[6] = 22;
}
```

**OR**

```
int[] ages = new int[7]; //declare and create 

void setup(){
  size(100,100);
  ages[0] = 29;  //assign
  ages[1] = 29;
  ages[2] = 28;
  ages[3] = 28;
  ages[4] = 26;
  ages[5] = 26;
  ages[6] = 25;
}
```

**OR**

```
int[] ages_of_BTS_members = {29, 29, 28, 28, 26, 26, 25};
//declare, create and assign all in one

void setup(){
  size(100,100);
}
```
### Name array example

```
String[] names = { "Sleepy","Dopey","Grumpy","Happy","Sneezy","Bashful","Doc" };

void setup(){
  size(100,100);
  println("Total dwarfs: "+names.length);
  println("The first dwarf: "+names[0]);
  println("The last dwarf: "+names[names.length-1]);
  //question: why do we specify name.length - 1?
}
```

### in-class challenge

How to pick a random dwarf name from the list?

Break it down:
1. how many names are there?
2. how do you pick a random number between 0 and the total number of names?
3. what do you need to do to 'clean' up this number (hint: consider that random produces a float)
4. how do you print the value stored at that numbered index in the array of names?

### Resources

- More about [arrays](https://processing.org/reference/Array.html) in the Processing reference.
- An additional [chapter about arrays](https://processing.org/tutorials/arrays/) from the book *Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists*.


## Using loops to initialize an array

Let's say we wanted to roll 5 dice.

```
int[] die = new int[5];
die[0] = random(1,7);
die[1] = random(1,7);
die[2] = random(1,7);
die[3] = random(1,7);
die[4] = random(1,7);
die[5] = random(1,7);
```

Instead, let's use a loop:

```
int [] die = new int[5];

for (int i = 0; i < die.length; i++){
    die[i] = int(random(1,7)); 
    //must convert from float to int. random produces floats!
}
```

Remember ```.length``` tells us how long the array is


#### In-class

* Create an array of 1000 floats. Initialize every element with random number between 0 and 10.

* Create and initialize an array of 100 integers. Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.

* Print the lowest value from an array of numbers.

### More on arrays

- Arrays are declared similarly to other data types but use a bracket to indicate a list of elements.
- After declaring an array, use ```new``` to create the array.
  ```data = new int[5];```
- Array's individual elements may have their value changed, but you cannot change the length of the array.

Where we're going next: *arrays of objects.*
